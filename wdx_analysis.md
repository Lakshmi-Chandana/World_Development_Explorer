## Introduction about Project
This project is all about working and exploring the world data from the site **World Development Explorer** which gives information regarding many topics that are needed to analyze the world's situation. We can get information by comparing many factors like different topics and different indicators. There is a possibility to check based on particular region and country or set of countries(as per the requirement). We have an option to check through different zones of income like high income, low income or middle income along with different lending types. Moreover, we can work on the information based on time span by selecting the required time span. All this information can be viewed in different types of charts like Bubble chart, Bubble and Line chart, 3D Scatter, 2D Scatter, Bar chat, Line chart, Pie chart, Histogram chart, Boxplot chart, Choropleth chart, Sunburst chart and Table chart. Also there are different group by options, different styles for the charts to be displayed, height of the resulting chart and the language of the resulting chart. Below the resulting chart, there is a description about the type of chart that we selecte and some options related to that.
- In my analysis, I would like to see information regarding Environment, Climate change and Health by taking these as the main topics and I have chosen Agricultural land(% land area), Population growth(annual %) and total population as indicators.
