# Introduction about Project
This project is all about working and exploring the world data from the site **World Development Explorer** which gives information regarding many topics that are needed to analyze the world's situation. We can get information by comparing many factors like different topics and different indicators. There is a possibility to check based on particular region and country or set of countries(as per the requirement). We have an option to check through different zones of income like high income, low income or middle income along with different lending types. Moreover, we can work on the information based on time span by selecting the required time span. All this information can be viewed in different types of charts like Bubble chart, Bubble and Line chart, 3D Scatter, 2D Scatter, Bar chat, Line chart, Pie chart, Histogram chart, Boxplot chart, Choropleth chart, Sunburst chart and Table chart. Also there are different group by options, different styles for the charts to be displayed, height of the resulting chart and the language of the resulting chart. Below the resulting chart, there is a description about the type of chart that we selecte and some options related to that.
### What is in this analysis
- In my analysis, I would like to see information regarding Environment, Climate change and Health by taking these as the main topics and I have chosen Agricultural land(% land area), Population growth(annual %) and total population as indicators for the selected countries i.e., Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia and Sri Lanka. The time period that I have selected is from 1988 to 1995. And I have selected Country as my group by option and Ploty_dark as my style for the resulting chart with height 600 px in English language. Initially I have selected bubble chart to display the data during the selected time span where we can use different charts to see the data in different types in later times of the analysis.
### Why is this analysis
- This type of investivations must be conducted often to check the position or graph of the world whether it is climbing up for the better situations or falling down so that the government can take necessary actions according to the results of this kind of exploration. There will be possibility for the government to take care of its people ahead before the situation goes out of the hands. Also we can find the areas to be developed, fields to be given importance, zones to be concentrated for the better of each area, country and the finally the world. And for the individual, this type of investigations help in gaining knowledge about different aspects in the world in different time periods and gets chance to work on this kind of data and with this experience, every interested individual can become a Data Analyst or Business Analyst.
### Observations from the analysis

**Note** - It is good to group by countries rather than region for better understanding of the information from the chart.

### Analysis from line chart
To explain the analysis more clearly, lets take line charts into consideration. We get three line charts as there are three indicators to be looked into. First lets see the below line chart which gives the information about Agricultural land i.e., the percenage of land area during the given time period 1988 to 1995 for the selected countries i.e., Brunei Darussalam, Sri Lanka, Malaysia.

Observe the chart below.

- The percentage of Agricultural land area for Sri Lanka is stable except during the year 1992 and 1993 with a very slight decrement in the agricultural land area. And it also has the highest percentage of agricultural land compared to Brunei and Malaysia with approximately 37%.

- The following country that has the highest agricultural land is Malaysia where there is a gradual increase in percent from 19.4 to 21.2 starting from the year 1988 to 1995.

- The last country that has the least agricultural land area among the selected three countries is Brunei Darussalam. According to the general data, this country occupies the last place because the total land area for Brunei is extremely small compared to other countries.

##### Now lets take the other line chart which gives us the information about Population growth (annual %) during the years 1988 to 1995 for the selected countries Brunei, Malaysia and Sri Lanka.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78044715/112643393-b6acbd80-8e1a-11eb-8a0b-bb463c2c5541.png)

- The country that concentrated good on annual population growth during the given time span is Sri Lanka with a cutback from 1.39 annual percent in the year 1988 to 0.81 percent in the year 1995 which is a good progess because the world's population is escalating very fast year by year.

- The next country that took care of annual population growth is Malaysia where the annual percentage of population growth in the year 1988 is 2.98 and it has come down to 2.5 by the year 1995.

- The smallest country Brunei Darussalam also took significant care in its annual population growth between the years 1988 and 1995. Though the annual perncent growth in population in 1988 is 2.83, it percent eventually tripped to 2.61 by the year 1995.

##### The final indicator that we look into is the total population of all the three countries. Below is the line chart which represents the same through the years 1988 to 1995.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78044715/112648443-eb6f4380-8e1f-11eb-89fe-32205f986b0b.png)

- Though Brunei Darussalam is the beautiful and smallest country among the countries that we have chosen, the total population of the country was maintained excellently through out our selected time period. The total population in the year 1988 was approximately 244 thousands and with a very slight enlargement, the total population by the end of the year 1995 was only approximately 297 thousands. This information states that the Brunei country is very stable or almost equal in the given time span.

- The population of the other two countries Malaysia and Sri Lanka are almost similar in the starting of our period i.e., 1988 with 17M for Malaysia and 16.8M for Sri Lanka. But gradually the difference between the two countries in their population count had shown a variance and it went increasing by the end of our selected time span i.e., the year 1995 where the population of Malaysia in the year 1995 is 20.4M and the population of the country Sri Lanka in the year 1995 is about 18.2M. From this information we can find that the overall population of the countries Malaysia and Sri Lanka had increased over the selected time period. To be more precise the total population of Malaysia had increased more when compared to other two countries.

### Analysis from Bubble chart

To explain the analysis through other type of chart i.e., bubble chart, let's look at the below explanation.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78044715/112721160-cc80b800-8ed8-11eb-8ed9-c6331cbc20b9.png)

Above is the bubble chart showing the information about percentage of agricultural land area, percentage of population growth annually, and the overall population of the given three countries Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia and Sri Lanka over the selected time period.
- In the year 1988, when we look into Brunei country, we can see the information from the bubble as percentage of agricultural land is 2.2, percentage of annual population growth is 2.8 and total population of the country is 244 thousands approximately.
- Let's look at Malaysia in the year 1988, we can know the information as percent of agricultural land area is 19.4, percent of annual population growth is 2.98 and 17,022 thousands nearly.
- When we see the other country Sri Lanka in the year 1988, it gives us the information like percentage of agricultural land area is 37.2, percent of annual population growth is 1.39 and the overall population in 1988 is 16,878 thousands.

If we want to see the trend of the countries through the given time stamp, we can see that through the animation of the bubbles flowing. In that way, Brunei Darussalam had not shown great changes till the year 1993, but there were significant changes in the year 1994 and 1995.

In the same way, we can see the animation of the country Malaysia, where it had shown changes in its values in through out the period, but more changes in the starting of the period and less changes comparitvely at the end.

Looking at the changes for the other country Sri Lanka through animation, we can observe that the annual population growth percentage is falling good, which is good thing to control the population. Because if the population goes on increasing year by year, there will not be enough resourses to fulfill all the needs of all the people which is why it is good to control the population growth. And there had been very slight differences in the pencentage of agricultural land. To look from another view, if the percentage of agricultural land has no change or decrease over the period, the country will not be able to feed all the people when population keeps on increasing. Stabilizing the population is important may be with minute changes.

Below is the image which shows the position of the countries in the year 1995.

I think the bubble chart serves a better purpose because we get to see the information in a single chart rather than three different charts like in the line chart as there are three indicators. The other better purpose is the concept of animation. The bubble moves according to the data in animated format in a single chart.
